# SUMMARY
I'm a self-taught UX designer. I found my passion to the user centered design field during the past few years. While I'm a stay at home mom. I completed the Google UX Design Certificate. A rigorous, hands-on program that covers the design process from end-to-end. I applied the UX design skills I gained through out the course to the three projects I worked on during the certificate. As, user-centered design, accessibility, and equity-focused design.
